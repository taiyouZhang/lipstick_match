# lipstick_match 
## Introduction
Find an interesting [blog](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y3kGNaslGBArh-seI15c0w), and try to implement the whole functionality.<br>
By the way, distinguish lipsticks is too hard for me. I hope this tool can help me in some ways.

## Data structure
+ src/match.py<br> 
    This file is the main source codes to classify lipsticks from screenshots.
+ data/pictures<br>
    All screenshots are put into this folder.
+ data/lipstick.json<br> 
    Copied from [Project:lipstick](http://zhangwenli.com/lipstick/)

## Next
1. Implement the face catch logic.
2. At first, we should put screenshots or photos on laptop.<br> Then, maybe we can install the program on phones.

## Warning
Since I have downloaded some pictures of lipsticks from websites, the precision of results is not good enough. Maybe the filter on photos is a big problem.
